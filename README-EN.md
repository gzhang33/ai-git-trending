## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lgy1027/ai-trending.git
    cd ai-trending
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    It's recommended to install in a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables**
    The project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit the `.env` file to add your `LLM_API_KEY` and `LLM_BASE_URL`.
    ```env
    # .env
    LLM_API_KEY="sk-your_api_key_here"
    LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1" # Change to your service's URL if using another provider
    LLM_MODEL="gpt-4-turbo" # Optional, defaults to gpt-4-turbo
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

The project has two main entry points:

### 1. Run the Report Generator

Run `run_reporter.py` to scrape and analyze projects, generating daily reports.

```bash
python run_reporter.py
```

### 2. Start the Web Service

Run `run_web.py` to start the local web server and access the interactive interface through your browser.

```bash
python run_web.py
```

Once the service is running, you can access it by default at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üê≥ Running with Docker

You can also use Docker to build and run this project, avoiding the need to configure a local Python environment.

1.  **Build the Docker image**
    In the project root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker build -t trending-reporter .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container**
    Use the `--env-file` flag to load your environment variables from the `.env` file:
    ```bash
    docker run --env-file .env trending-reporter
    ```
    Once the container starts, the program will run just like it does locally: it will execute one task immediately and then enter scheduled mode.
